              This game is fully complete with multiple levels, music, and sound
              effects to enhance the overall gaming experience. By leveraging
              the Processing (Java) framework, I ensured smooth graphics
              rendering and responsive controls, creating a seamless and
              enjoyable gameplay environment.

              I worked on ClassBooster, a proprietary algorithm to generate
              smart seating charts. Specifically I led the frontend team and
              personally built the authentication pages (login, signup, forgot
              password, etc.) and the home page.
